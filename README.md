# Ki-GCN
Ki-GCN (Kinship-Graph Convolutional Network), a novel kinship-based graph deep learning approach used to identify genome variants that are associated with diseases or traits.
The Ki-GCN is a graph autoencoder utilizing both the information from the genome variants matrix and the family structure information from the kinship matrix. It uses sample variants matrix and kinship matrix of samples as input, the otput is the identified variants matirx.
